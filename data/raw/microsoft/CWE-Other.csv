CVE-2013-1451	CWE-16 	Allows remote attackers to spoof web sites via a crafted HTML document		Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9, when the Proxy Settings configuration has the same Proxy address and Port values in the HTTP and Secure rows, does not ensure that the SSL lock icon is consistent with the Address bar, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof web sites via a crafted HTML document that triggers many HTTPS requests to an arbitrary host, followed by an HTTPS request to a trusted host and then an HTTP request to an untrusted host, a related issue to CVE-2013-1450.
CVE-2013-1450	CWE-16 	Allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information intended for a specific host via a crafted HTML document		Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9, when the Proxy Settings configuration has the same Proxy address and Port values in the HTTP and Secure rows, does not properly reuse TCP sessions to the proxy server, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information intended for a specific host via a crafted HTML document that triggers many HTTPS requests and then triggers an HTTP request to that host, as demonstrated by reading a Cookie header, aka MSRC 12096gd.
CVE-2012-0147	CWE-16 	Unfiltered Access to UAG Default Website Vulnerability		Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) 2010 SP1 and SP1 Update 1 does not properly configure the default web site, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted HTTPS request, aka "Unfiltered Access to UAG Default Website Vulnerability."
CVE-2011-1652	CWE-16 			** DISPUTED ** The default configuration of Microsoft Windows 7 immediately prefers a new IPv6 and DHCPv6 service over a currently used IPv4 and DHCPv4 service upon receipt of an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA), and does not provide an option to ignore an unexpected RA, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on communication with external IPv4 servers via vectors involving RAs, a DHCPv6 server, and NAT-PT on the local network, aka a "SLAAC Attack." NOTE: it can be argued that preferring IPv6 complies with RFC 3484, and that attempting to determine the legitimacy of an RA is currently outside the scope of recommended behavior of host operating systems.
