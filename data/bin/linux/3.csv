CVE-2007-5087,CWE-264,"The ATM module in the Linux kernel before 2.4.35.3, when CLIP support is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by reading /proc/net/atm/arp before the CLIP module has been loaded."
CVE-2007-4849,CWE-264,"JFFS2, as used on One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) build 542 and possibly other Linux systems, when POSIX ACL support is enabled, does not properly store permissions during (1) inode creation or (2) ACL setting, which might allow local users to access restricted files or directories after a remount of a filesystem, related to legacy modes and an inconsistency between dentry permissions and inode permissions."
CVE-2007-4573,CWE-264,"The IA32 system call emulation functionality in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.22.7, when running on the x86_64 architecture, does not zero extend the eax register after the 32bit entry path to ptrace is used, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an out-of-bounds access to the system call table using the %RAX register."
CVE-2007-3849,CWE-264,"Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 ships the rpm for the Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) before 0.13.1 with a database that lacks checksum information, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass file integrity checks and modify certain files."
CVE-2007-3740,CWE-264,"The CIFS filesystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22, when Unix extension support is enabled, does not honor the umask of a process, which allows local users to gain privileges."
CVE-2007-3532,CWE-264,"NVIDIA drivers (nvidia-drivers) before 1.0.7185, 1.0.9639, and 100.14.11, as used in Gentoo Linux and possibly other distributions, creates /dev/nvidia* device files with insecure permissions, which allows local users to modify video card settings, cause a denial of service (crash or physical video card damage), and obtain sensitive information."
CVE-2007-0004,CWE-264,"The NFS client implementation in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3, when a filesystem is mounted with the noacl option, checks permissions for the open system call via vfs_permission (mode bits) data rather than an NFS ACCESS call to the server, which allows local client processes to obtain a false success status from open calls that the server would deny, and possibly obtain sensitive information about file permissions on the server, as demonstrated in a root_squash environment.  NOTE: it is uncertain whether any scenarios involving this issue cross privilege boundaries."
CVE-2006-7098,CWE-264,"The Debian GNU/Linux 033_-F_NO_SETSID patch for the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.34-4 does not properly disassociate httpd from a controlling tty when httpd is started interactively, which allows local users to gain privileges to that tty via a CGI program that calls the TIOCSTI ioctl."
CVE-2006-6662,CWE-264,"Unspecified vulnerability in Linux User Management (novell-lum) on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 and Open Enterprise Server 9, under unspecified conditions, allows local users to log in to the console without a password."
CVE-2006-4572,CWE-264,"ip6_tables in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 2.6.16.31 allows remote attackers to (1) bypass a rule that disallows a protocol, via a packet with the protocol header not located immediately after the fragment header, aka ip6_tables protocol bypass bug; and (2) bypass a rule that looks for a certain extension header, via a packet with an extension header outside the first fragment, aka ip6_tables extension header bypass bug."
CVE-2006-1524,CWE-264,"madvise_remove in Linux kernel 2.6.16 up to 2.6.16.6 does not follow file and mmap restrictions, which allows local users to bypass IPC permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with zeroes, aka the MADV_REMOVE vulnerability.  NOTE: this description was originally written in a way that combined two separate issues.  The mprotect issue now has a separate name, CVE-2006-2071."
CVE-2005-3623,CWE-264,"nfs2acl.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.14.4 does not check for MAY_SATTR privilege before setting access controls (ACL) on files on exported NFS filesystems, which allows remote attackers to bypass ACLs for readonly mounted NFS filesystems."
CVE-2005-3273,CWE-264,"The rose_rt_ioctl function in rose_route.c for Radionet Open Source Environment (ROSE) in Linux 2.6 kernels before 2.6.12, and 2.4 before 2.4.29, does not properly verify the ndigis argument for a new route, which allows attackers to trigger array out-of-bounds errors with a large number of digipeats."
CVE-2005-3257,CWE-264,"The VT implementation (vt_ioctl.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.12, and possibly other versions including 2.6.14.4, allows local users to use the KDSKBSENT ioctl on terminals of other users and gain privileges, as demonstrated by modifying key bindings using loadkeys."
