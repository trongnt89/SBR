CVE-2015-0074,CWE-119,"Vulnerabilities in Adobe Font Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3032323) This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted file or website. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the Affected Software section.The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the font parser allocates memory and by correcting how objects in memory are handled. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Vulnerability Information section. Adobe Font Driver in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 does not properly allocate memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted (1) web site or (2) file, aka Adobe Font Driver Denial of Service Vulnerability."
