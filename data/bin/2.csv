CVE-2015-0060,CWE-20,"Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3036220) This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or visit an untrusted website that contains embedded TrueType fonts. This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1; it is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the Affected Software section. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver validates certain parameters against registered objects, validates and enforces impersonation levels, handles objects in memory, validates data returned from user mode functions before being executed, handles TrueType Font error checking, and checks font widths prior to loading fonts into memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Vulnerability Information section. The font mapper in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 does not properly scale fonts, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka Windows Font Driver Denial of Service Vulnerability."
